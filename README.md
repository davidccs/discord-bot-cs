# CoomBot
Discord Bot for League of Legends Coom Squad

The Custom Discord Bot is a unique and personalized bot that I have built specifically for my Discord server. It is designed to cater to the specific needs and requirements of my community, providing a tailored experience that reflects the interests and preferences of my server members.

# Features 
- Custom Commands: The bot includes a set of custom commands that I have developed to cater to the specific needs of my server. These commands can perform various tasks, such as retrieving server-specific information, providing custom responses, and executing special actions.
- Integration with External APIs: The bot integrates with external API (Riot games) to fetch real-time data or perform actions based on external services. This enables me to provide dynamic and up-to-date information to my server members, enhancing their experience.
- Event Handling: The bot handles various events within the Discord server, such as new member joins, message updates, and reactions. It can execute specific actions or trigger custom responses based on these events, adding interactivity and engagement to the server.
